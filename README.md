# RADDAM_2019

###
All the scripts will be made available for general use.
They are probably not useable from scratch but will be modified to ensure usability from a given format.

To run the Gaussian_Beam_Global_N_Specific.py, you would first need
i) Global Intensity decay values (a script will be provided to be ran on CrystFEL Stream if needed)
ii) Specific Damage values (from the integration script, an extra intermediate step might be needed if you want more than one atom value)

All these will be modified to be used in a more friendly way.
